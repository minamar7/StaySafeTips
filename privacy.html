    <p>Stay Safe Elite is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and how users maintain control over their data.</p>

    <h2>1. No Account Required</h2>
    <p>Stay Safe Elite does not require user registration. We do not create user accounts and we do not operate backend servers that store personal profiles.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All progress data (XP, Levels, Badges, quiz results) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using browser-based LocalStorage technology within the app environment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal data is transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your locally stored progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Users may delete all stored data at any time by clearing the app cache/data from Android settings or uninstalling the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app uses Google AdMob and Google AdSense to display advertisements. These services may automatically collect certain information for advertising and analytics purposes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Android Advertising ID</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
        <li>IP address (used for approximate location detection)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
        <li>Diagnostic and crash data (if provided by Google services)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This information is processed directly by Google in accordance with their Privacy Policy. Stay Safe Elite does not access, store, or control this third-party data.</p>

    <p>Users may opt-out of personalized advertising through:

    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade user data. Any data collected through advertising services is handled exclusively by Google as an independent data controller.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Stay Safe Elite does not retain personal user data on external servers. Any information collected by third-party advertising providers is retained according to their respective data retention policies.</p>

    <h2>6. On-Device Tools (Elite Checkup)</h2>
    <p>The “Elite Checkup” feature analyzes limited device metrics (such as battery level and network status) in real-time. All processing occurs locally on your device. No system data is transmitted, stored, or shared externally.</p>

    <h2>7. External Links</h2>
    <p>The app may contain links to external platforms (such as social media). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites or services.</p>

    <h2>9. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users maintain full control of their local data. Since we do not operate centralized user databases, there is no account-based data to access or delete beyond local device storage.</p>

    <h2>10. Consent</h2>
    <p>By using Stay Safe Elite, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
